Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I am Anirudh, a second-year student at MIT
studying electrical engineering and computer science (Course 6-2).
<br />
<br />
I love solving problems that people face daily, from creating more efficient
transportation systems that help us live in a cleaner future to developing
platforms to create connections on campus. Here are
<a href="http://www.anirudhv27.github.io/projects/"
  >a few standout personal projects</a
>
that I've worked on.
<br />
<br />
Aside from my personal endeavors, I am also fascinated by the application of
automation to efficient systems. I am currently conducting intelligent
infrastructure research at
<a href="http://www.wucathy.com/blog/">Prof. Cathy Wu's Lab</a> under the lab's
AlphaDrive project, using computer vision to impute traffic inflow data at
intersections with the goal of reducing carbon emissions.
<br />
<br />
Some of my hobbies include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Learning languages (Aside from English, I speak Hindi, Spanish, Telugu, and
    a bit of German!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Dancing for MIT's competitive Bollywood Team
    <a href="http://mirchi.mit.edu/">Mirchi</a>, where I am in charge of the
    team's finances.
  </li>
  <li>Hiking, camping, and exploring nature (Yosemite is an all-time favorite!)</li>
</ul>
