Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I am Anirudh, a second-year student at MIT
studying electrical engineering and computer science (Course 6-2).
<br />
<br />
I love solving problems that people face daily, from creating more efficient
transportation systems that help us live in a cleaner future to developing
platforms to create connections on campus. Here are
<a href="https://anirudhv27.github.io/projects"
  >a few standout personal projects</a
>
that I've worked on.
<br />
<br />
Aside from my personal endeavors, I am also fascinated by the application of
automation to efficient systems. I am currently conducting intelligent
infrastructure research at
<a href="http://www.wucathy.com/blog/">Prof. Cathy Wu's Lab</a> under the lab's
AlphaDrive project, using computer vision to impute traffic inflow data at
intersections with the goal of reducing carbon emissions.
