<p>With the advent of fully technologically integrated vehicles, modern tech and car companies have innovated several novel ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù solutions to interface with the vehicle‚Äôs technology, such as Apple‚Äôs <em>CarPlay</em> system or Tesla‚Äôs touchscreen</p>

<p>our team of 5 noticed that computer interfaces controlling everything from media controls and navigation to temperature and phone control gestures.
