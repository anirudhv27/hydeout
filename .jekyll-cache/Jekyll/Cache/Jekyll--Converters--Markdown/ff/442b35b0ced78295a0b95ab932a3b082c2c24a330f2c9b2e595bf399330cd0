  <p>Noticing the rapid innovations being worked on in the field of human-computer interfaces for personal vehicles, as well as the need for an accessible and solution, our team of 5 developed an interconnected embedded system to prototype a car interface controlled primarily through the use of computer vision and hand gestures.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Utilized the ESP32 microcontrollerâ€™s HC-06 Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities (coded using C++ and the Arduino framework)</li>
    <li>Developed a backend computer vision algorithm to detect hand gestures from still Arducam images (developed with OpenCV in Python)</li>
    <li>Integrated several pieces of crucial hardware such as the Arducam and DFPlayer MP3 system to provide a fully integrated user experience that interfaces with the user's mobile device.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated prototype for a gesture-based control system for a car's navigation, media control, temperature, and communication capabilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Socialyze is a web-based social media platform for MIT students to connect with each other, while providing a forum for students to discover events and other group activities on campus.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Curated seamless user experience using functional CSS animations and the Chakra UI component library (React.js).</li>
    <li>Designed robust backend in Node.js (MongoDB and Next.js), using GraphQL APIs for relevant database access. Hosted unsupervised ML-based recommendation system on this backend to find ideal matches for our users based on previous activity.</li>
    <li>Built real-time messaging system from scratch with individual and group message capabilities (Express.js, Socket.io).</li>
  </ul>
